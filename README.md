# Guess the Number

<sub>Developed with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) by [Rafael Marques](https://github.com/rafamarquesrmb)</sub>

**Guess the Number** is a simple console game where you have 3 difficulty levels. You will play against the computer, and you must match the number the computer has chosen as quickly as possible! If you make a mistake, the computer will give you a hint if you are above or below the number informed.

- Level 1 has a range between 1 and 10.
- Level 2 has a range between 1 and 100.
- Level 3 has a range between 1 and 1000.

## About

This application runs on the console. It was built with **Elixir**, a powerful and modern functional programming language.

It was inspired by the tutorial by "_David Alencar_", a Brazilian Developer, founder of [Elly Academy](https://github.com/ellyacademy). It has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCED1QpeMYP4apdCVGjBqhCg) and a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXlyLSVDkhI&list=PLydk1OOOmzo8VBeU334j4R4WvSByRNpXR) with an introduction to Elixir, where this app was built.
